## Usage

```python
# Initialize the agent
agent = FinancialRiskAgent()

# Load and preprocess data
df, preprocessor = agent.load_and_preprocess_data()

# Train the models
agent.train_models(df, preprocessor)

# Example customer data
customer = {
    'customer_id': 12345,
    'age': 45,
    'income': 85000,
    'savings': 75000,
    'debt': 120000,
    'credit_score': 710,
    'education_level': 'Bachelor',
    'employment_status': 'Employed',
    'has_mortgage': 1,
    'has_dependents': 1,
    'market_sentiment': 0.2,
    'past_investment_returns': 0.06
}

# Analyze risk for the customer
risk_assessment = agent.analyze_customer_risk(customer)

# Print the assessment
print(json.dumps(risk_assessment, indent=2))
```
